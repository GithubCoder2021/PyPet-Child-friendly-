# PyPet
A Virtual Pet Game for Python

The current version is a very rough, command line-based, working draft that has not implemented the classes yet.

Version 2 will implement classes & refactor code in a logical & efficient manner.  It will also incorporate Colored Terminal Text.

Version 3 will add a Graphical Element with either Pygame or Kivy
