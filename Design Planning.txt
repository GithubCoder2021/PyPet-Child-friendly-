Design Notes for Refactoring for Next Version

Things I need to learn:
    Subclassing & Super

Game Needs To:
    1.  Save State
            Use Database:
                Check if Database is empty.
                    if empty: Write Defaults to Database 
                        Method 1: Maybe pull defaults from text file
                        Method 2: Hardcode into program (probly better)
            Initialize Pet by reading in from Database
            Write To Database upon close() command


    2.  Be based on Real Time:
            Time Module
                see time.py
            Checks Last Time Played
            Allows for long time lapses
                Only kills pet if excessively long
                Otherwise, leaves Pet in a very bad state
            Checks Pet Age
                Encourages Player by celebrating certain Time & Age Milestones
                    Months, Birthday, etc
                Pet Eventually Dies
            Tracks Hours & AM/PM
                Hours also calculate time since last action
                    If you haven't action'd in certain time, game may give helpful hints

    3.  Game Hints:
            Game will give specific hints if player isn't doing well
                "Maybe you should feed your cat"
                "You haven't played in a while"
                "Talking's probly not gonna help here"


    4.  Action & Animal State Messages:
            Per Animal - Least Redundancy Possible
                Consider using a dictionary or list
                    Generators or List Comprehensions

    5.  Text Coloring:
            Colorama - Other libraries are OS dependent or impractical
                for ones requiring escape codes, I could just store globals
            Color Needs to be able to be turned On & Off

    6.  Player Action Functions:
            Code in least redundant way
                Either via Parent Class functions
                    Or via animal functions if necessary
                        The goal is to have functions be independent of Pet Type
                            And then to have Messages be per Pet Type

    7.  Intro Screen:
            Welcomes player
            Gets Animal Type, & Name
            Pet_Name says Hello

    8.  Menu for Player Actions:
        Pet
        Play
        Ignore
        Throw
        Talk
        Give Up (Player abandons Pet & Loses)
        Quit (Game Saves State - you can come back later)

    9.  Game Loop

    10.  Game Over Function


Possibly Beyond Scope:
    Introduce Pet Friends, or an owner??

List of Player Actions:
    Feed
    Pet
    Play
    Ignore
    Throw
    Talk

Database should store:
   hungry
   starved
   bored
   upset
   violent
   sleepy
   awake/asleep
   weight
   age
   photo (ASCII)

   Counters for each stat
